The `cobaltResumePro` is an update on the `cobaltResumePro` package and
was designed to create resumes with a more streamlined design (the
design for th. is to create professionally-looking resumes and cover
letters in RStudio. LaTeX code has been written in the
`cobaltResume.cls`, `cobaltCoverLetter.cls`, `cobaltResume.tex`, and
`cobaltCoverLetter.tex` files to format the resume and cover letter
files. I have written my own resume and cover letter using
`cobaltResume`, which can be viewed [my
resume](https://github.com/sebsciarra/cobaltResume/blob/main/man/resume_cover_letter.pdf).
Note that the cover letter is populated with placeholder content. In the
sections that follow, I will explain the following four components to
using `cobaltResume`:

1)  Installation
2)  Project creation
3)  Creating a résumé
4)  Creating a cover letter
5)  Merging the résumé and cover letter into one PDF file

The goal of `cobaltResume` is to create professionally-looking résumés
and cover letters. Here is a résumé and cover letter I created for
myself using `cobaltResume`:

## 1) Installation

You can install the development version of cobaltResume GitHub and load
it into your session with:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sebsciarra/cobaltResume")
library(cobaltResume)
```

## 2) Project creation

To create a `cobaltResume` template, click on **File** \> **New
Project** \> **New Directory**. Then select **Résumé and cover letter
project using cobaltResume** from the dropdown menu as shown below.

<img src="man/figures/resume_project.png" width="50%" height="50%" />

THen, give your project a name and specify where you’d like the files to
appear. In the screenshot below, the project name is
`my_resume_cover_letter` will appear as a new folder on the Desktop.

<img src="man/figures/project_name.png" width="50%" height="50%" />

## 3) Creating a résumé

In the `resume.Rmd` file, a résumé can be completed by using three
features. First, information related to identification and skills can be
included in the résumé by filling in the appropriate YAML header
variables shown below.

``` yaml
firstName: "firstName"
lastName: "lastName"
position: "Position" #job position being applied to 
date: "date" 
output: 
  pdf_document:
    template: "cobaltResume.tex" #template file (do not change)
#hyperlinks (delete or leave blank blank if not necessary/do not exist)
#escape any special characters with two backslashes (for example, see email variable)
githubLink: "github.com/user" #link to GitHub
githubName: "githubHandle" #GitHub username
personalWebsite: "personalwebsite.com"
linkedinName: "firstName lastName"
linkedinLink: "linkedin.com/in/personal_link"
email: "email\\@domain.com" 
#skills + citizenship
skills: "R, SQL, Python, LaTeX, Bash, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Machine learning, Data science, Data visualization, Knowledge translation" #skills relevant to the job
citizenship: "Citizenship status" #e.g., work permit/study permit/Permanent resident/citizen, etc.
```

Second, sections can be created in the `resume.Rmd` file and
accessorized with fontawesome icons (for a full list, see [fontawesome
icons](http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/CTAN/fonts/fontawesome5/doc/fontawesome5.pdf)).
For example, `\faSuitcase\ Employment` results in the header shown
below.

<img src="man/figures/example_header.png" width="25%" height="25%" />

Third, résumé entries can be completed using `create_resume_entry()`.
Two examples are provided below.

``` r
create_resume_entry(title = "PhD, Industrial-Organizational Psychology", 
                 subtitle = "University of Guelph", 
                 date = "Sep. 2018--May 2023", 
                 first_point = "Thesis title: \\textbf{Is Timing Everything? The Effects of Measurement Timing on the \\newline Performance of Nonlinear Longitudinal Models}", 
                 second_point = "Conducted Monte Carlo simulation experiments using R on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance to evaluate the performance of structured latent growth curve models under several conditions", 
                 third_point = "My thesis can be viewed  \\href{\\detokenize{https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10214/27543/Sciarra_Sebastian_202304_PhD.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y}}{\\textcolor{blue}{here}}")

create_resume_entry(title = "\\href{sebastiansciarra.com}{sebastiansciarra.com}\\footnote{clickable hyperlink to the corresponding repository on my GitHub}", subtitle = "Personal website", date = "Mar. 2023", 
                 first_point = "Used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create a personal website for writing blog posts",
                 second_point = 'Blog posts focus on statistics, machine learning, and coding by explaining technical details, providing demonstrations, and conducting simulation experiments', 
                 third_point = 'Blog posts use code from a variety of language to explain content. As an example, my post titled ``\\href{https://sebastiansciarra.com/coding_tricks/em_demo/}{\\textcolor{blue}{Coding and Visualizing the Expectation-Maximization Algorithm}}" used R, Python, and CSS code')
```

Note that LaTeX code can be inserted and will be rendered. The above two
examples produce the following two entries in the resulting PDF file:

<img src="man/figures/education.png" width="65%" height="65%" /><img src="man/figures/personal_website.png" width="65%" height="65%" />

As an aside, there is an asterisk at the end of the personal website,
because it is a clickable hyperlink to the corresponding GitHub
repository. This not shows up as a footnote, as shown below.

<img src="man/figures/hyperlink_footnote.png" width="65%" height="65%" />

## 4) Creating a cover letter

In the `cover_letter.Rmd` file, a résumé can be completed by using three
features. First, information related to identification and skills can be
included in the résumé by filling in the appropriate YAML header
variables shown below.

``` yaml
firstName: "firstName"
lastName: "lastName"
position: "Position" #job position being applied to 
date: "date" 
output: 
  pdf_document:
    template: "cobaltCoverLetter.tex"
hyperlinks (delete or leave blank blank if not necessary/do not exist)
#escape any special characters with two backslashes (for example, see email variable)
githubLink: "github.com/user" #link to GitHub
githubName: "githubHandle" #GitHub username
personalWebsite: "personalwebsite.com"
linkedinName: "firstName lastName"
linkedinLink: "linkedin.com/in/personal_link"
email: "email\\@domain.com" 
#recruiter info 
recruiterName: "Recruiter Name"
organization: "Organization Name"
organizationStreet: "200 Bay St."
organizationCityPostal: "Toronto, ON M5J 2J2"
#greeting/closing + citizenship
greeting: "Dear Mr./Mrs. Recruiter Name"
emailClosing: "Sincerely"
citizenship: "Citizenship status" #e.g., work permit/study permit/Permanent resident/citizen, etc.
```

## 5) Merging the résumé and cover letter into one PDF

To merge the résumé and cover letter into one PDF, make sure that each
`.Rmd` file exists in its own folder (as is the case when the project is
first created). With the résumé and cover letter `.Rmd` files in their
own folders, they can be merged by specifying the `knit` YAML variable
in either the `résumé .Rmd` and/or the `cover_letter.Rmd` file(s) such
that

``` yaml
knit: cobaltResume::merge_resume_cover_letter
```
